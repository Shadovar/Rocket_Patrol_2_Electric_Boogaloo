    Point Breakdown:
        50: Simultaneous Local Multiplayer
        25: New artwork for all assets (rocket-> orca, starship-> moose, explosion-> orca eating moose)
        15: Create new title screen (recolored and organized text, and that logo was quite annoying to make read properly)
                (Perhaps only worth 10, given that I generally kept the text box formatting)
        10: Create new scrolling tile sprite for the background (stars-> ocean with small chunks of ice)
        10: Allow the player to control the rocket after it is fired
        
Based on code found at: https://github.com/nathanaltice/RocketPatrol
